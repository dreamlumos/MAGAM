# MAGAM

### Introduction

The objective of this project was to implement the Multi-Aspect Generic Adaptation Model (MAGAM) proposed by Monterrat et al. and to connect it to the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model. 

MAGAM is a generic model that makes it possible to adapt and personalise learning activities according to different aspects that characterise a learner (cognitive profile, motivational profile, time constraints for training, etc.).

BKT is a probabilistic model based on the Hidden Markov Model that calculates the belief of a system on a learnerâ€™s level of mastery of specific concepts in a certain domain (mathematics, medicine, physics, biology, etc.).

We were supervised for this project by Amel Yessad, associate professor at Sorbonne University and part of the MOCAH (Models and Tools in Knowledge Engineering for Human Apprenticeship) team of the LIP6 laboratory.
